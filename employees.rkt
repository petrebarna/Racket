;; Data definitions:

; 
; PROBLEM A:
; 
; You work in the Human Resources department at a ski lodge. 
; Because the lodge is busier at certain times of year, 
; the number of employees fluctuates. 
; There are always more than 10, but the maximum is 50.
; 
; Design a data definition to represent the number of ski lodge employees. 
; Call it Employees.
; 


;; Employees is Natural(10, 50]
;; Interp. range of employees working at a ski lodge at one time

(define E1 11)
(define E2 40)
(define E3 50)

; PROBLEM B:

; Now design a function that will calculate the total payroll for the quarter.
; Each employee is paid $1,500 per quarter. Call it calculate-payroll.
