; PROBLEM:
; 
; Extend the following world program to have a mouse handler such that 
; whenever the mouse is clicked ("button-down") the cat moves to the 
; mouse's x coordinate.
; 


;; A cat that walks from left to right across the screen.

;; =================
;; Constants:

(define WIDTH 600)
(define HEIGHT 400)

(define CTR-Y (/ HEIGHT 2))

(define SPEED 3)

(define MTS (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT))

(define CAT-IMG .)




;; =================
;; Data definitions:

;; Cat is Number
;; interp. x position of the cat in screen coordinates
(define C1 0)           ;left edge
(define C2 (/ WIDTH 2)) ;middle
(define C3 WIDTH)       ;right edge
