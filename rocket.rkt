;; Data definitions:

; 
; PROBLEM A:
; 
; You are designing a program to track a rocket's journey as it descends 
; 100 kilometers to Earth. You are only interested in the descent from 
; 100 kilometers to touchdown. Once the rocket has landed it is done.
; 
; Design a data definition to represent the rocket's remaining descent. 
; Call it RocketDescent.
; 


;; RocketDescent is one of:
;; - Number(0, 100]
;; - false
;; Interp. false if rocket's descent has ended, otherwise number of kilometers left to Earth

; 
;  Note - The type comment:
;  ;; RocketDescent is one of:          
;  ;; - Number[0,100]
;  ;; - false
;  is also a reasonable solution to the problem.   
;
