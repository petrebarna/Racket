; Complete problem (C) from the reference rule videos.
; 
; "Design a function that consumes information about schools and produces 
; the school with the lowest international student tuition."

; The function should consume a ListOfSchool. Call it cheapest.

; ;; ASSUME the list includes at least one school or else
; ;;        the notion of cheapest doesn't make sense
