; PROBLEM:
; 
; Design an animation of a traffic light. 
; 
; Your program should show a traffic light that is red, then green, 
; then yellow, then red etc. For this program, your changing world 
; state data definition should be an enumeration.
; 
; Here is what your program might look like if the initial world 
; state was the red traffic light:
; .
; Next:
; .
; Next:
; .
; Next is red, and so on.
; 
; To make your lights change at a reasonable speed, you can use the 
; rate option to on-tick. If you say, for example, (on-tick next-color 1) 
; then big-bang will wait 1 second between calls to next-color.
; 
; Remember to follow the HtDW recipe! Be sure to do a proper domain 
; analysis before starting to work on the code file.
; 
; Note: If you want to design a slightly simpler version of the program,
; you can modify it to display a single circle that changes color, rather
; than three stacked circles. 
;
